					Welcome to UnAadhar! Your chance to make document verification easier everywhere!
				</h6>
				<p>
					UnAadhar is an open source, free and easy to use face based verification service for users and developers.
				</p>
				<p>
					With UnAadhar you can store all your legal documents right in your browser (securely and locally). You can upload
					documents and details that are generally required by a large number of web services just by showning your face!
				</p>
				<p>
					So to get started you need to register your face and a fallback password (Face Verification is just not there yet!
					:P) with us. Then upload the documents that websites usually ask from you for Proof of Identity/Address (PAN Card,
					License, Bills, Passport, <strike>Aadhar</strike>) and we'll take care of the rest!
